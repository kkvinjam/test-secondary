### Overview - Beta
 
In this workshop, we will explore the AWS Control Tower service, show how a Control Tower Administrator can enable guardrails and detect violations in the Control Tower Dashboard, and show how Transit Gateway can be integrated with accounts managed by Control Tower. 

#### Prerequisites

These labs assume that the user has already deployed Control Tower, and thus has access to the three core accounts that it creates.
