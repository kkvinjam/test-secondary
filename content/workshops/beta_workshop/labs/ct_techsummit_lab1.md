## Overview ##

AWS Control Tower provides the easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment based on best practices established through AWSâ€™ experience working with thousands of enterprises as they move to the cloud. With AWS Control Tower, builders can provision new AWS accounts in a few clicks, while you have peace of mind knowing your accounts conform to your company-wide policies. 

AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of approved IT services for use on AWS. In a multi-account environment, the AWS Service Catalog portfolios can be managed centrally at the Management account and distribute across the remaining accounts across the AWS Organizations. 

In this lab, we will walkthrough: 1)some of the common tasks an AWS Control Tower Administrator perform on a day-to-day basis; 2) a way to centrally manage the commonly deployed self-service catalogs. This lab is broken in to two tasks:

* Task-1: Common tasks of AWS Control Tower.
* Task-2: Centrally manage the commonly deployed services.

##### Terminologies used in this lab:
* **Management Account**: AWS Control Tower Management account, where we deployed the Control Tower service.
* **Spoke Account**: An Account in AWS Control Tower Environment, other than the Management account.
* **Administrator**: AWS SSO User with AdministratorAccess permissions.
* **EndUser**: AWS SSO User with minimum required permissions.
* **Portfolios**: AWS Service Catalog portfolio is a collection of products, together with configuration information.
* **Product**: AWS Service Catalog product is an IT service that you want to make available for deployment on AWS.
* **Constraints**: Constraints control the ways that specific AWS resources can be deployed for a product.

##### Things to know before Getting Started
* The instructions below are based on old console of CloudFormation and they could vary if you are using new console of CloudFormation.
* _HIGHLY RECOMMEND_ to switch your CloudFormation console to **_Previous Console_**. This can be done by clicking on Hamburger Icon top left, and  **_Previous Console_** on the CloudFormation Console.
<img src="images/Previous_console.png" width="10%" height="10%">
* If you prefer to use the latest console, please feel free to do so with appropriate changes at the required steps of this lab. Instructions not included in this lab.
* For Task-1, please stick to one of the **supported regions** (Oregon, Ohio, N.Virginia, Ireland).

## Task-1 : Common tasks of AWS Control Tower ##

John is an application architect in a financial services organization. His organization has compliance requirements to store the last three-year log files of several applications running in his environment. 

Sam is the cloud architect, who is part of the CCOE team in the same organization and responsible for cloud architecture. Sam decided to use the pre-configured centralized logging account in the AWS Control Tower to archive log files from all the applications running in multiple accounts. Sam wants to ensure that the environment is secure and at the same time, give flexibility to John's team to design his applications without a need to reach out to the Cloud Architecture team.

Sam provided access to John to log in to log archive account and desgin S3 buckets as required for his applications.

In this part of the lab, we will walk through:

* Enable a guardrail on the Organizational Unit.
* Creating an AWS SSO user in AWS Control Tower.
* Capturing any violations in the Control Tower Environment as the application teams deploy the resources.

## Task-2 : Centrally manage the commonly deployed services

Samâ€™s team identified a common set of workloads that application team uses. Both teams collaboratively created CloudFormation templates for these patterns with all best practices, and fine tuning needed for applications, along with organizations compliance and tagging policies in place. 

Samâ€™s team want to make these portfolios available to all the newly vended AWS accounts as they get vended. We will see how Sam used Service Catalog to centrally manage these resources from Management and distribute to rest of the accounts as they get vended.

**PS:** Due to logistical issues of this lab, we will use Security OU [old installations: Core OU] which consists of log and audit AWS accounts to share the Service catalog portfolios to vended AWS accounts. In practice, these portfolios from Management are shared to various other OUs in the organization.
