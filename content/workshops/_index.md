Depending on the time you have available and how complex the scenarios you would like to explorer we have a number of different workshop tracks, for you. In all cases we recommend that you consider any current deployment of organisation within which your have production workloads or colleagues are actively developing products as a production organisation. So unless you already have a sandbox organisation, to test deploy and develop your multi-account strategies and practices then you want to create one to explore Control Tower in.

The workshops take you from a fresh standalone AWS account, through deploying Control Tower and then through various scenariosi. Of course once you have an environment up and running you can pick labs from the various theme based collections to meet your interests.
